The " Disease Prediction using Random Forest classifier" project is to create a system that uses the Random Forest algorithm to predict diseases based on a variety of variables ( 132 symptoms from the dataset ).
The research involves gathering a dataset that contains details on diseases and the characteristics that are related to them. After handling any missing values, the dataset is pre-processed to make it ready for training. 
The ensemble learning technique Random Forest classifier is used to train the prediction model. 
To generate precise predictions, this algorithm integrates several decision trees. The trained model is assessed for performance and accuracy using the right metrics. 
The model generates disease predictions based on the user.
